# To Do App

## Description

_Duration:_ Weekend project

This is a basic ToDo list, where a user make a checklist of things to do, and mark them off as they complete them.

In building this app, I practiced skills for full stack integration, connecting a jQuery-powered front-end through a node server to a SQL database.
